## Purpose

- Used to identify patterns which can be observed by naked eye


## Types of analysis

- Univariate - raw data info
- Bivariate - link between label and dependent variable
- Mulivariate - link between mltiple variables - genrally dimensionality reduction is used and visualised in 2D or 3D

## Examples of analysis from the notebooks in the site

- Univariate - PIMA data (logistic regression): We plot each variable of the data and observe right skewed data. The outliers drag the regression line far so we clean up the data to reduce outliers.
- Bivariate - linear regression data: We plot relationship between income, age and experience and observe no clear reationship between age and income. So we go ahead and work with experience and income columns.
